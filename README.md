# simple-ajax-crud
Best reason why we create this program is for educational purposes. If you are a back developer and still using PHP programming language, you can take this program for your crud web app. Don't forget you need to refactoring code and think about security if you already take this program.

Why? because we know, we just only develop about ajax crud. Add some validations and filtering about vulnerability IDOR when you delete the data. You can do regex when the user try to send payload XSS and etc etc etc.
